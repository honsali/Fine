##Critical Issues
1. Speech Recognition Lifecycle Management
kotlin// In AddRoute.kt - potential memory leak
val speechRecognizer = remember(recognitionAvailable) {
    if (recognitionAvailable) SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(context) else null
}
The speechRecognizer is created in composition but the DisposableEffect cleanup happens too late. If the composable recomposes frequently, you could create multiple recognizers.
Recommendation: Move to ViewModel or use rememberUpdatedState more carefully.

2. Permission Handling Race Condition
kotlinvar permissionRequested by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
This flag doesn't survive configuration changes. If user rotates device during permission flow, the flag resets and could trigger duplicate permission requests.
Fix: Move permission state to ViewModel.

3. Date Parser Edge Cases
In DateParser.parseDayOfMonth():
kotlinrepeat(14) {
    val length = candidate.lengthOfMonth()
    if (day <= length) {
        if (candidate.month == referenceDate.month && candidate.year == referenceDate.year) {
This only looks back 14 months. What if someone says "le 15" on March 1st but last entered expense was February 14th? Edge case but could confuse users.

4. Amount Parser Ambiguity
kotlintrimmed.contains(',') && trimmed.contains('.') -> {
    // Assume comma is decimal separator when mixed.
    trimmed.replace(".", "").replace(',', '.')
}
This assumption breaks for European format 1.200,50 (one thousand two hundred) vs 1.200.50 (ambiguous). The parser would misinterpret this.
Suggestion: Add validation or stricter rules for mixed separators.

##Medium Priority Issues
5. UI State Management
kotlin// AddExpenseViewModel.kt
fun cancel() {
    _uiState.value = AddExpenseUiState()
}
Direct assignment instead of update {}. While this works, it's inconsistent with other methods. Prefer update everywhere for clarity.

6. Missing Error Boundaries
The app has no global error handling. If Room throws an unexpected exception, the app could crash. Consider:
kotlinclass FineApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler { _, throwable ->
            // Log to file or show recovery UI
        }
    }
}

7. Accessibility Concerns

No content descriptions for voice recording state
No TalkBack announcements when moving between steps
Mic button has no semantic role indicator

Add:
kotlinIcon(
    imageVector = Icons.Filled.Mic,
    contentDescription = stringResource(R.string.action_start_recording),
    modifier = Modifier.semantics { role = Role.Button }
)

8. CSV Export Security
kotlinprivate fun escapeCsv(value: String): String =
    if (value.contains(';') || value.contains('"') || value.contains('\n')) {
        "\"${value.replace("\"", "\"\"")}\""
    } else {
        value
    }

Good! But missing carriage return (\r) check. Some Excel versions are picky.


##Minor Issues & Suggestions 

9. Hardcoded Strings in Code
kotlinval zone = ZoneId.of("Africa/Casablanca")
Should be in gradle.properties or a config object for easier updates.

10. No Data Validation on Insert
kotlinoverride suspend fun addExpense(...): Result<Long> = runCatching {
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
        val entity = ExpenseEntity(
            description = description, // What if description is 10,000 chars?
Add length limits:
kotlinrequire(description.length <= 500) { "Description trop longue" }
require(amountMinor > 0) { "Montant invalide" }

11. Theme Could Be Enhanced
Your color scheme is nice but:

No elevation/shadow definitions
Missing surfaceTint for Material 3
Dark mode colors could have better contrast ratios (test with accessibility scanner)

12. Missing Proguard Rules
For release builds, add Room-specific rules:
proguard-keep class app.fine.data.local.** { *; }
-dontwarn androidx.room.**

13. Room Migration Strategy
kotlin.fallbackToDestructiveMigration().build()
This is fine for personal use, but document in comments that upgrading will wipe data. Consider adding export reminder before updates.
Performance Observations 

14. LazyColumn Keys Missing
kotlinitems(state.months) { month ->
    MonthlyHistoryCard(...)
}
Should be:
kotlinitems(state.months, key = { it.yearMonth.toString() }) { month ->
This improves recomposition efficiency.
15. Unnecessary Recompositions
kotlinval dateFormatter = remember {
    DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy")
}
Good use of remember! But in HistoryScreen, both formatters could be hoisted to a singleton object since they never change.
